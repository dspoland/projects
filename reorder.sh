## end game:

## download spreadsheet/file from drive
## find items in low category
## compare diff against previous version
## slackbot notification of things in low that hasn't already been notified

#!/bin/bash

. ./drive-lsit.sh

#rename previous file to old file

# drive_list.py

#download file as new

#compare to old file
## or set specific values to compare to (file would be best, so admins can edit)


#diff in toreorder.txt list

# slack alert for changes

#repeat on *d/*h/17m
# should do each day at 7:17 (or pick specific time)
